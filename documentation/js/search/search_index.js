It also has Angular animations\nClone project\nPress the Clone or download button, choose the SSH option and copy the SSH key. Then in your terminal for example if you use Git Bash, PowerShell or another, first create a directory where the project repository will be stored, once created, enter git clone SSH key copiedfor example git clone git@github.com:Luis-1896/Market.git.\nRestore node_modules of the angular project\nFirst we move to the folder where the content of the project is from the terminal and enter npm install, with this the node_modules folder is restored with all the libraries and imports important for the project.\nSet up the project with a new Firebase\nFirst we go to the Firebase page and create a project by pressing the Get Started button, once the project is created, and according to the following image, we copy the attributes of firebaseConfig to our project in the enviroments.ts file\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCompodoc\nRun npm rum compodocto see the structure of the project developed. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/.\nCreate an Admin user to upload products\nIn Firebase choose the Authentication option and in access method enable E-mail / password.\n\n\n\nWhen the project server is running with ng serve, it is located in the sign up menu, fill in the data and then in Firebase choose the Database option and you will see that the root was created with the name of users and later the id which gives firebase to the user created with attributes that you entered. In the admin field you can select it and in value put false.\n\n\n\nOnce the user is created and modified to admin, you can log in and in the Dashboard menu, you can add your products with the name, price and a product image.\n\n\n\nSee the added products\nIn Home you can see all the added products that both you and admin and other users can buy the products that can be seen in the Cart menu\n\n\n\nSee the products in the cart\nYou can see the products added to the cart and be able to modify the purchase or delete it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
